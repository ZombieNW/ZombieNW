I'm a teenage developer who specializes in Node.JS and HTML/CSS/JS.
My proudest accomplishment is making a overly-polished clone of Pong in 3D for the Wii that loads from a disc complete with banners/id's.
Currently working on making a unique way of adding content(items/blocks/discs/other) to Minecraft using PaperMC.
